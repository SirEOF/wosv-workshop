### -- Things You Should Know About Web Security if You Write Code

This repository contains a series of offensive security exercises, based
on [Stripe CTF 2.0](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag-20).

Each exercise is written in Ruby, and has its own README.md to get you

But first! Make sure you have a working Ruby installation by following
this documentation: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation.
